<h3 align="left">密钥泄露勿缺勿滥 ———Argus</h3>

- 🔭 We are the Argus team, dedicated to detecting sensitive information leaks in open-source repositories and preventing security risks such as exposed credentials.
- 🌱 Our team integrates cutting-edge technologies, including automated scanning, machine learning, and efficient security strategies, to ensure the security of codebases. 
- 👯 If you are interested in our work, feel free to reach out—we look forward to collaborating to enhance open-source security!

<h3 align="left">OUR SKILL </h3>

- 🤔 We specialize in detecting credential leaks using RE (Regular Expressions) + Agent-based approaches, combining rule-based pattern matching with intelligent automation. 
- 💬 Our methodology leverages precise regular expression-based detection to identify sensitive information efficiently, while our agent-driven system enhances detection accuracy through contextual analysis and adaptive learning.
- 📫 By integrating these techniques, we ensure comprehensive and scalable secret detection, minimizing false positives while effectively securing open-source repositories.
- 😄  Our team continuously refines our detection strategies to stay ahead of emerging security threats.
