**密钥泄露勿缺勿滥 ———Argus**

We are the Argus team, dedicated to detecting sensitive information leaks in open-source repositories and preventing security risks such as exposed credentials. Our team integrates cutting-edge technologies, including automated scanning, machine learning, and efficient security strategies, to ensure the security of codebases. 

If you are interested in our work, feel free to reach out—we look forward to collaborating to enhance open-source security!

<h3 align="left">OUR SKILL </h3>

We specialize in detecting credential leaks using RE (Regular Expressions) + Agent-based approaches, combining rule-based pattern matching with intelligent automation. Our methodology leverages precise regular expression-based detection to identify sensitive information efficiently, while our agent-driven system enhances detection accuracy through contextual analysis and adaptive learning.

By integrating these techniques, we ensure comprehensive and scalable secret detection, minimizing false positives while effectively securing open-source repositories. Our team continuously refines our detection strategies to stay ahead of emerging security threats.
